## Overview

This project demonstrates the foundational principles of web development. Using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, I built a functional and visually appealing user interface that is fully responsive. This hands-on experience has been vital in my journey to create modern web applications.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See the social media share links when they click the share icon

### What I learned

This project has been vital to my development journey, as I've learned how to effectively manipulate elements using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.share-content {
  position: absolute;
  background-color: hsl(217, 19%, 35%);
  width: 260px;
  height: 55px;
  margin-left: 240px;
  /* margin-left: 350px;
    margin-bottom: 5px; */
  border-radius: 10px;
  /* margin: 20px; */
  justify-content: center;
  display: flex;
  margin-top: 6px;
  visibility: hidden;
  box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px;
}
```

```js
var btn = document.querySelector(".image");

const widBtn = function () {
  var checkingVisibility = document.querySelector(".share-content");

  if (checkingVisibility.style.visibility === "visible") {
    checkingVisibility.style.visibility = "hidden";
  } else {
    checkingVisibility.style.visibility = "visible";
  }
};

const repBtn = function () {
  var checkingVisibility = document.querySelector(".content");

  if (checkingVisibility.style.visibility === "hidden") {
    checkingVisibility.style.visibility = "visible";
  } else {
    checkingVisibility.style.visibility = "hidden";
  }
};

btn.addEventListener("click", widBtn);

var btn2 = document.querySelector(".foot-image");

btn2.addEventListener("click", repBtn);
```

### Continued development

Continuing my journey, I'll focus on mastering responsive design, a critical skill in this industry.
